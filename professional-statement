I am a highly motivated worker with strong written and verbal communication skills that also enjoys solving problems. I place high value on protecting individuals from various threat actors and striving for data protection for all, especially marginalized communities. Although I am well-adept at writing reports and business continuity plans, I am extremely excited about using various tools and my prior experience in both networking and supervisory roles to mitigate these attacks while protecting an organization.
